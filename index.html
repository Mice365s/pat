    <h1>Welcome to the site computers</h1>
    <p><b>Here you will learn everything about computers and job occupations that have things to do with computing or should we say IT job.</b></p>
    <p>
        Firstly what do you know about computers?, Do you want to know more??, Do you feel like chasing a job in IT? sayless here we will be helping u understand what we mean by computers and clear the path for you in the IT world.
        
        <h2>What is a computer?</h2>
        
        To know this we will have to dive back to 1822, yes that's a long time ago. But this is were we will find the first computer made for mankind. In 1822 the first computer was invented by Charles Babbage who was a methematician and a philosopher, he originated the concept of digital programmable computer. He is well known as the "father of the computer", but it was not until 1991 were we met Alan Turin who invented computer science which is now the study of computers and computational systems.
        Computers are used everywhere in our daily lives. Now I'm sure that when we talk about computers you think we are talking about what you have in the offices, No we call those PCs(personal computers) they also fall under computers.
        When we talk about computers we talk about machine/technological devices that allow input, process the data and output the results.
        Computers vary from "smartphones" , "PCs" , "ATM machines"etc. These machines are made to make our lives easier.
        Now computers have to important componants which are software and hardware. Let's start with hardware, hardware is the physical part of a computer, they are the part you can touch and feel for example printers, keybaords monitors etc.
        These hardware are made so that you can use your computers properly like how you use your keyboards for typing and inputing data and your monitor for dislpaying the results.
