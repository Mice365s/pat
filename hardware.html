    <h1>Hardware Devices</h1>
    <p>Hardware is the physical part of a computer, they are the part you can touch and feel for example printers, keybaords monitors etc.
       These hardware are made so that you can use your computers properly like how you use your keyboards for typing and inputing data and your monitor for dislpaying the results.
       Hardware devices are also broken into two different parts which are the internal and external devices.
       <h2>Internal device are:</h2>
       <ul type = "disc">
        <li>Motherboard</li><img src = "images/motherboard.jpg">
        <li>CPU</li><img src = "images/CPU.jpg">
        <li>RAM</li><img src = "images/RAM.jpg">
        <li>Hard Drive</li><img src = "images/Hard-Drive.jpg">
        <li>Graphics Card</li><img src = "images/Graphic-Card.jpg">
        <li>Network card</li><img src = "images/Network-card.webp">
       </ul> 
       Internal devices are the sensetive parts of the computer. By "sensetive" we mean that if this devices come to contact with water or anything that can demage them your computer will stop operating and it would cost you money to replace or fix them.

       <h2>External Devices:</h2>
       <ul type = "disc">
        <li>Keyboard</li><img src = "images/keyboard.webp">
        <li>Monitor</li><img src="images/monitor.jpg">
        <li>Mouse</li><img src = "images/mouse.png">
        <li>Speakers</li><img src = "images/Speakers.jpg">
        <li>Printers</li><img src = "images/printers.jpg">
        <li>Computer Case</li><img src ="images/computer-case.jpg">
       </ul>
       External devices are the devices that you use daily when you use your computer. They are the ones that make using computers a lot easier, their responsibilty is less complicated compared to the internal devices cause they are embedded devices meaning they only perform one task and these tasks are to help the users.
       The monitor is for displaying the results the computer wants to show you, for example displaying images, videos, text etc.
       Speakers are for helping the user hear what is being said in the video or when the user is playing music
       But of course you know what these devices are for if not you can go to the details page which will help you get a better understanding about these devices.
       If you are wondering where the internal devices are stored in a computer, they are stored in what we call "computer case". The computer case is where the motherboard, ram and all the other components are stored.
       Now having a printer is not a must but its a adviced to have one.

       <h3>Considerations</h3>
       If you are considering buying a laptop there are alot of things you should consider and no its not the brand because brands differ for different people.
       Before buying a computer there questions you should ask yourself, This questions are:
       <ul type = "disc">
        <li><b>What computer operating system is best for me?</b></li>
        <li><b>How much RAM and power will my computer need?</b></li>
        <li><b>What's the ideal storage capacity of a desktop computer?</b></li>
        <li><b>Does a computer need a graphics card?</b></li>
        <li><b>Should I get an all-in-one desktop computer or a tower computer?</b></li>
       </ul>
    </p>
